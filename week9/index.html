							<h1>The Farm</h1>
							<br />
							<p>
								Seeds of Solidarity Farm was initiated in 1996, on land in the middle of the forest
								that had not been cultivated for many years, and the original inhabitants of the
								region being the Wampanoag, Nipmuc, and Pequoit people. A conservation restriction
								on our 30 acres ensures the land will always be used for agriculture, education, and
								wildlife habitat. With nature as teacher, the land has been transformed into fertile
								fields and hosts 5 solar hoophouses brimming with our signature greens, fruit and
								perennial crops, garlic and sacred, traditional crops such as Hopi blue and
								Narraganset flour corn. The tapestry of our site includes energy efficient and off
								the grid home, office, and farm outbuildings, including
								<a href="#">Solidarity Handworks</a>, a solar powered farmstand, and celebration art
								and words of inspiration along the paths.

							<h2>School Gardens</h2>
							<p>
								We have a long and vibrant history of helping schools establish school gardens
								locally and throughout the Northeast. School gardens are a wonderful way to engage
								students in developing life-long skills for food resiliency, health, and healing
								through connecting to the earth and each other. School gardens and composting
								programs are an exciting element of the growing “Farm to School” movement.
								Curricular connections and opportunities for service learning abound!
							</p>
							<p>
								We offer an annual workshop for school and community educators at our site each
								summer. Our 2013 workshop is Weds Aug 14, contact us for details and to register. In
								addition, we can provide customized Grow Food Everywhere (TM) workshops and
								trainings at your school (contact us for fees).
							</p>
							<p>
								We created and are happy to offer these school garden resources to support your
								growing and learning for education purposes! They are free downloads and never
								funded by any corporate sponsors, so if you are inspired and find them useful, feel
								free to make a contribution, and please do cite Seeds of Solidarity when using.

							<h2>Grow Food Everywhere for Health and Justice</h2>
							<p>
								This webpage details our ‘Grow Food Everywhere’ program evolution. We have created
								over 50 raised bed gardens in a variety of settings that engage community members of
								all ages in growing and enjoying fresh food freely. Over the years, these were
								created at schools, health care facilities, childcare centers, public libraries, and
								more recently women’s centers, jails, and a recovery center.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our Grow Food Everywhere program for family childcare providers helps nourish young
								children and their families. Through a partnership with the Franklin County House of
								Corrections, we teach gardening for incarcerated men and women. We were also pleased
								to partner with Greenfield Community College, Montague Catholic Social Ministries,
								and New England Center for Women in Transition and the Women’s Fund of W.Mass on the
								GARDEN project that supports food and economic resilience for low-income women and
								those who have experienced trauma. Additionally, a partnership with Heywood Hospital
								and their Quabbin Retreat center for those in recovery from substance abuse engaged
								us in creating therapeutic gardens and related programming at their site in
								Petersham MA.
							</p>
							<p>
								Program History: First there were gardens for 7 schools (2003-2006 implementation)
								then at the Athol Memorial Hospital, then community food resiliency came to exciting
								fruition in 2011 with the launch of our Grow Food Everywhere for Health and Justice
								initiative. Our community suffers from hunger, childhood obesity and economic
								despair. In uplifting response and towards wellness for all, we created raised bed
								gardens that provide nutrition education and real food for anyone in need at our
								local community health center.
							</p>
							<p>
								In 2012 we added gardens at the Orange Innovation Center, a converted factory, cared
								for by tenants and master gardener Pat Conrad who brings food to the Orange Food
								Pantry. In addition, by the end of 2012, twenty low-income families received raised
								beds abundant with salad greens, tomatoes, cukes and beans. Fresh food for all, one
								household at a time. Then we created gardens at the local public library, the North
								Quabbin Community Co-op, and the Orange Food Pantry.
							</p>
							<p>
								A garden creation begins with the arrival of community resources: locally milled
								lumber, a truck filled with rich soil from Clearview Compost, and a crew of
								enthusiastic Seeds of Solidarity staff and sometimes volunteers. Seeds of Solidarity
								staff and youth leaders visit through the season. Grow Food Everywhere beds can
								include a “mini-hoophouse” to extend abundant crops and much-needed nourishment of
								their family well into the winter, and enable an early start to fresh salads come
								spring.
							</p>
							<p>
								History:Through our Grow Food Everywhere for Health and Justice initiative we
								initially created gardens at the homes of families facing hunger as well as
								throughout the community. But joblessness, landlord problems or domestic violence
								sometimes meant they had to leave their homes… and gardens. Simultaneously, we
								realized that there were many women in our community who ran family childcare
								programs at their homes, and that these providers could reach 10-12 children and
								their families-many in need of nourishment in all forms- through one garden. And,
								they had the enthusiasm and flexibility to integrate garden learning into the day,
								and to use their fresh harvest for snacks and lunches. Over the past two years, this
								program has blossomed a supportive and enthusiastic network of family childcare
								providers, inspired many young children to grow, prepare and enjoy healthy
								vegetables, increase physical activity, cultivate connection to nature, and extend
								fresh joy to their families.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								“I’m diabetic, my 14 year old son is pre-diabetic, and my 9 year old daughter is
								gluten free…being able to provide a variety of fresh vegetables to both my children
								is not only a benefit financially but helps me meet my personal goal of opening the
								door to the wonderful world of fresh, clean foods to my children.”
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“I don’t have the money to buy fresh foods…a great benefit of the garden is having
								fresh foods for my children that are not filled with chemicals from mass producers.”
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“Patients were really thrilled to have the opportunity to pick their vegetables
								right after seeing a doctor or nutritionist. I’d often take them out to the gardens
								with a bag, and off they’d go. We have a lot of folks with great need and they were
								very happy to be able to get some extra food…and I was happy to be able to give them
								vegetables rather than pop-tarts.”Mary Sieruta MS, Registered Dietician, Community
								Health Center of Franklin County
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								” I know I have the skill set from SOL Garden to help my community grow food, and I
								plan to do so in the future.” Cassandra, Youth Leader

								have a sense of what is possible in the coming year. This is a multi-day program
								that we will hold for ages 20-24,
							</h3>
							<p>
								We celebrated 20 years of SOL (Seeds of Leadership) Garden in 2018, our longest
								running program, and an amazing, life-changing experience for youth and staff alike!
								We have transitioned this to our Craft Your Own Life Program, and hope others will
								learn from our resources and curricula below.
							</p>
							<p>
								Since the programs inception in 1998, 400 SOL Garden participants, most low-income
								and underemployed, have gained valuable life, college and career skills as they
								have: Cultivated a quarter acre garden and donated thousands of pounds of vegetables
								to families and senior citizens in our low-income community; Constructed their own
								40′ solar greenhouse and designed and built the “SOL Shack” meeting space; Helped
								planted and tend gardens throughout the community at a shelter for homeless
								families, elementary schools, a hospital and health center, a library and for local
								families; Created and sold hundreds of ceramic SOL Bowls ; Given over 30
								presentations at conferences and events; participated in Earth and Spirit youth
								retreats and outdoor adventure, workshops in nutrition, cooking, and healing arts,
								celebration art, and helped thousands learn, celebrate, and play at the North
								Quabbin Garlic and Arts Festival.
							</p>
							<p>
								SOL Garden is free to local youth, and made possible through grants from the MA
								Cultural Council Youth Reach Program, The AT and T Aspire Program, The Green Leaf
								Foundation, and individual contributions.

								<h1>About Us</h1>
								<p>
									Seeds of Solidarity was founded by Ricky Baruc and Deb Habib who met in 1984 while
									working at the New Alchemy Institute on Cape Cod MA, a small international
									organization whose purpose was to “design human-scale, low polluting alternatives
									to super technology and to design and test intensive food growing methods.” New
									Alchemy’s impact on Ricky and Deb’s lives and that of many others was profound.
									They spent the next decade or so farming (Ricky) and working in the fields of
									multicultural and environmental education (Deb). Then in 1994/1995 took part in
									the International Pilgrimage for Peace and Life, walking from Auschwitz to
									Hiroshima. Seeds of Solidarity Farm and Education Center was initiated in 1996, in
									the spirit of New Alchemy and in honor of those around the world helping to feed
									the people.
