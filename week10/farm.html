							<p>
								Seeds of Solidarity Farm was initiated in 1996, on land in the middle of the forest
								that had not been cultivated for many years, and the original inhabitants of the
								region being the Wampanoag, Nipmuc, and Pequoit people. A conservation restriction
								on our 30 acres ensures the land will always be used for agriculture, education, and
								wildlife habitat. With nature as teacher, the land has been transformed into fertile
								fields and hosts 5 solar hoophouses brimming with our signature greens, fruit and
								perennial crops, garlic and sacred, traditional crops such as Hopi blue and
								Narraganset flour corn. The tapestry of our site includes energy efficient and off
								the grid home, office, and farm outbuildings, including
								<a href="#">Solidarity Handworks</a>, a solar powered farmstand, and celebration art
								and words of inspiration along the paths.
