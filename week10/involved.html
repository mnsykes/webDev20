					<h2>School Gardens</h2>
					<p>
						We have a long and vibrant history of helping schools establish school gardens locally
						and throughout the Northeast. School gardens are a wonderful way to engage students in
						developing life-long skills for food resiliency, health, and healing through connecting
						to the earth and each other. School gardens and composting programs are an exciting
						element of the growing “Farm to School” movement. Curricular connections and
						opportunities for service learning abound!
					</p>
					<p>
						We offer an annual workshop for school and community educators at our site each summer.
						Our 2013 workshop is Weds Aug 14, contact us for details and to register. In addition,
						we can provide customized Grow Food Everywhere (TM) workshops and trainings at your
						school (contact us for fees).
					</p>
					<p>
						We created and are happy to offer these school garden resources to support your growing
						and learning for education purposes! They are free downloads and never funded by any
						corporate sponsors, so if you are inspired and find them useful, feel free to make a
						contribution, and please do cite Seeds of Solidarity when using.

					<h2>Grow Food Everywhere for Health and Justice</h2>
					<p>
						This webpage details our ‘Grow Food Everywhere’ program evolution. We have created over
						50 raised bed gardens in a variety of settings that engage community members of all ages
						in growing and enjoying fresh food freely. Over the years, these were created at
						schools, health care facilities, childcare centers, public libraries, and more recently
						women’s centers, jails, and a recovery center.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our Grow Food Everywhere program for family childcare providers helps nourish young
						children and their families. Through a partnership with the Franklin County House of
						Corrections, we teach gardening for incarcerated men and women. We were also pleased to
						partner with Greenfield Community College, Montague Catholic Social Ministries, and New
						England Center for Women in Transition and the Women’s Fund of W.Mass on the GARDEN
						project that supports food and economic resilience for low-income women and those who
						have experienced trauma. Additionally, a partnership with Heywood Hospital and their
						Quabbin Retreat center for those in recovery from substance abuse engaged us in creating
						therapeutic gardens and related programming at their site in Petersham MA.
					</p>
					<p>
						Program History: First there were gardens for 7 schools (2003-2006 implementation) then
						at the Athol Memorial Hospital, then community food resiliency came to exciting fruition
						in 2011 with the launch of our Grow Food Everywhere for Health and Justice initiative.
						Our community suffers from hunger, childhood obesity and economic despair. In uplifting
						response and towards wellness for all, we created raised bed gardens that provide
						nutrition education and real food for anyone in need at our local community health
						center.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2012 we added gardens at the Orange Innovation Center, a converted factory, cared for
						by tenants and master gardener Pat Conrad who brings food to the Orange Food Pantry. In
						addition, by the end of 2012, twenty low-income families received raised beds abundant
						with salad greens, tomatoes, cukes and beans. Fresh food for all, one household at a
						time. Then we created gardens at the local public library, the North Quabbin Community
						Co-op, and the Orange Food Pantry.
					</p>
					<p>
						A garden creation begins with the arrival of community resources: locally milled lumber,
						a truck filled with rich soil from Clearview Compost, and a crew of enthusiastic Seeds
						of Solidarity staff and sometimes volunteers. Seeds of Solidarity staff and youth
						leaders visit through the season. Grow Food Everywhere beds can include a
						“mini-hoophouse” to extend abundant crops and much-needed nourishment of their family
						well into the winter, and enable an early start to fresh salads come spring.
					</p>
					<p>
						History:Through our Grow Food Everywhere for Health and Justice initiative we initially
						created gardens at the homes of families facing hunger as well as throughout the
						community. But joblessness, landlord problems or domestic violence sometimes meant they
						had to leave their homes… and gardens. Simultaneously, we realized that there were many
						women in our community who ran family childcare programs at their homes, and that these
						providers could reach 10-12 children and their families-many in need of nourishment in
						all forms- through one garden. And, they had the enthusiasm and flexibility to integrate
						garden learning into the day, and to use their fresh harvest for snacks and lunches.
						Over the past two years, this program has blossomed a supportive and enthusiastic
						network of family childcare providers, inspired many young children to grow, prepare and
						enjoy healthy vegetables, increase physical activity, cultivate connection to nature,
						and extend fresh joy to their families.
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						“I’m diabetic, my 14 year old son is pre-diabetic, and my 9 year old daughter is gluten
						free…being able to provide a variety of fresh vegetables to both my children is not only
						a benefit financially but helps me meet my personal goal of opening the door to the
						wonderful world of fresh, clean foods to my children.”
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						“I don’t have the money to buy fresh foods…a great benefit of the garden is having fresh
						foods for my children that are not filled with chemicals from mass producers.”
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						“Patients were really thrilled to have the opportunity to pick their vegetables right
						after seeing a doctor or nutritionist. I’d often take them out to the gardens with a
						bag, and off they’d go. We have a lot of folks with great need and they were very happy
						to be able to get some extra food…and I was happy to be able to give them vegetables
						rather than pop-tarts.”Mary Sieruta MS, Registered Dietician, Community Health Center of
						Franklin County
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						” I know I have the skill set from SOL Garden to help my community grow food, and I plan
						to do so in the future.” Cassandra, Youth Leader

						Stay tuned for info about our 2021 ‘Craft Your Own Life’ mini-internship once we have a
						sense of what is possible in the coming year. This is a multi-day program that we will
						hold for ages 20-24,
					</h3>
					<p>
						We celebrated 20 years of SOL (Seeds of Leadership) Garden in 2018, our longest running
						program, and an amazing, life-changing experience for youth and staff alike! We have
						transitioned this to our Craft Your Own Life Program, and hope others will learn from
						our resources and curricula below.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since the programs inception in 1998, 400 SOL Garden participants, most low-income and
						underemployed, have gained valuable life, college and career skills as they have:
						Cultivated a quarter acre garden and donated thousands of pounds of vegetables to
						families and senior citizens in our low-income community; Constructed their own 40′
						solar greenhouse and designed and built the “SOL Shack” meeting space; Helped planted
						and tend gardens throughout the community at a shelter for homeless families, elementary
						schools, a hospital and health center, a library and for local families; Created and
						sold hundreds of ceramic SOL Bowls ; Given over 30 presentations at conferences and
						events; participated in Earth and Spirit youth retreats and outdoor adventure, workshops
						in nutrition, cooking, and healing arts, celebration art, and helped thousands learn,
						celebrate, and play at the North Quabbin Garlic and Arts Festival.
					</p>
					<p>
						SOL Garden is free to local youth, and made possible through grants from the MA Cultural
						Council Youth Reach Program, The AT and T Aspire Program, The Green Leaf Foundation, and
						individual contributions.
