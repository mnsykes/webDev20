					<h1 class="display-4">School Gardens</h1>
					<p>
						We have a long and vibrant history of helping schools establish school gardens locally
						and throughout the Northeast. School gardens are a wonderful way to engage students in
						developing life-long skills for food resiliency, health, and healing through connecting
						to the earth and each other. School gardens and composting programs are an exciting
						element of the growing “Farm to School” movement. Curricular connections and
						opportunities for service learning abound!
					</p>
					<p>
						We offer an annual workshop for school and community educators at our site each summer.
						In addition, we can provide customized Grow Food Everywhere (TM) workshops and trainings
						at your school (<a href="contact.html#contact-form">contact us</a> for fees).

					<h1 class="display-4">Grow Food Everywhere for Health and Justice</h1>
					<p>
						We have created over 50 raised bed gardens in a variety of settings that engage
						community members of all ages in growing and enjoying fresh food freely. Over the years,
						these were created at schools, health care facilities, childcare centers, public
						libraries, and more recently women’s centers, jails, and a recovery center.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our Grow Food Everywhere program for family childcare providers helps nourish young
						children and their families. Through a partnership with the
						<a href="https://www.fcso-ma.us/" target="_blank"
							>Franklin County House of Corrections</a
						>, we teach gardening for incarcerated men and women. We were also pleased to partner
						with
						<a href="https://www.gcc.mass.edu/" target="_blank">Greenfield Community College</a>,
						<a href="https://mcsmcommunity.org/" target="_blank"
							>Montague Catholic Social Ministries</a

						and the
						<a href="https://www.mywomensfund.org/" target="_blank"

						and those who have experienced trauma. Additionally, a partnership with

						for those in recovery from substance abuse engaged us in creating therapeutic gardens
						and related programming at their site in Petersham, MA.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Program History</strong>: First there were gardens for seven schools (2003-2006
						implementation) then at the
						<a href="https://www.atholhospital.org/" target="_blank">Athol Memorial Hospital</a>,
						then community food resiliency came to exciting fruition in 2011 with the launch of our
						Grow Food Everywhere for Health and Justice initiative. Our community suffers from
						hunger, childhood obesity and economic despair. In uplifting response and towards
						wellness for all, we created raised bed gardens that provide nutrition education and
						real food for anyone in need at our local community health center.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2012 we added gardens at the
						<a href="https://orange-innovation.com/" target="_blank"> Orange Innovation Center</a>,
						a converted factory, cared for by tenants and master gardener Pat Conrad who brings food
						to the
						<a href="https://www.fccmp.org/orange-ma-food-pantry/" target="_blank"
							>Orange Food Pantry</a
						>. In addition, by the end of 2012, 20 low-income families received raised beds abundant
						with salad greens, tomatoes, cukes and beans. Fresh food for all, one household at a
						time. Then we created gardens at the local public library, the
						<a href="https://quabbinharvest.coop/" target="_blank">North Quabbin Community Co-op</a
						>, and the
						<a href="https://www.fccmp.org/orange-ma-food-pantry/" target="_blank"
							>Orange Food Pantry</a
						>.
					</p>
					<p>
						A garden creation begins with the arrival of community resources: locally milled lumber,
						a truck filled with rich soil from
						<a href="https://recyclingworksma.com/recycler/clear-view-composting/" target="_blank">
							Clearview Compost</a
						>, and a crew of enthusiastic Seeds of Solidarity staff and sometimes volunteers. Seeds
						of Solidarity staff and youth leaders visit through the season. Grow Food Everywhere
						beds can include a “mini-hoophouse” to extend abundant crops and much-needed nourishment
						of their family well into the winter, and enable an early start to fresh salads come
						spring.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>History:</strong> Through our Grow Food Everywhere for Health and Justice
						initiative we initially created gardens at the homes of families facing hunger as well
						as throughout the community. But joblessness, landlord problems or domestic violence
						sometimes meant they had to leave their homes… and gardens. Simultaneously, we realized
						that there were many women in our community who ran family childcare programs at their
						homes, and that these providers could reach 10-12 children and their families-many in
						need of nourishment in all forms- through one garden. And, they had the enthusiasm and
						flexibility to integrate garden learning into the day, and to use their fresh harvest
						for snacks and lunches. Over the past two years, this program has blossomed a supportive
						and enthusiastic network of family childcare providers, inspired many young children to
						grow, prepare and enjoy healthy vegetables, increase physical activity, cultivate
						connection to nature, and extend fresh joy to their families.

					Stay tuned for info about our 2021 ‘Craft Your Own Life’ mini-internship once we have a
					sense of what is possible in the coming year. This is a multi-day program that we will

				<br />
				<p>
					We celebrated 20 years of SOL (Seeds of Leadership) Garden in 2018, our longest running
					program, and an amazing, life-changing experience for youth and staff alike! We have
					transitioned this to our Craft Your Own Life Program, and hope others will learn from our
					resources and curricula below.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the programs inception in 1998, 400 SOL Garden participants, most low-income and
					underemployed, have gained valuable life, college and career skills as they have:
					cultivated a quarter acre garden and donated thousands of pounds of vegetables to families
					and senior citizens in our low-income community; constructed their own 40′ solar
					greenhouse and designed and built the “SOL Shack” meeting space; helped planted and tend
					gardens throughout the community at a shelter for homeless families, elementary schools, a
					hospital and health center, a library and for local families; created and sold hundreds of
					ceramic SOL Bowls; given over 30 presentations at conferences and events; participated in
					Earth and Spirit youth retreats and outdoor adventure, workshops in nutrition, cooking,
					and healing arts, celebration art, and helped thousands learn, celebrate, and play at the
					<a href="https://garlicandarts.org/" target="_blank"
						>North Quabbin Garlic and Arts Festival</a
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					SOL Garden is free to local youth, and made possible through grants from the
